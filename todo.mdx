Recommended Next Steps
YAML Support - Add yaml parsing to accept .yaml/.yml files
URL Loading - Add useApiSpec({ url: 'https://...' }) support
Enhanced Search - Add useSearch() hook with advanced filtering
Request Execution - Add useExecuteOperation() for interactive docs
Code Snippets - Add useCodeSnippet(operation, language) utilities

1. YAML Support
   ✅ Added js-yaml dependency
   ✅ Updated parseOpenApi to accept JSON strings, YAML strings, or parsed objects
   ✅ Full test coverage including YAML parsing
   ✅ Graceful error handling for invalid formats
2. URL Loading Support
   ✅ Created useApiLoader hook with caching, retries, and error handling
   ✅ Updated ApiProvider to support url prop for remote spec loading
   ✅ Comprehensive test coverage for URL fetching scenarios
   ✅ Cache management with clearSpecCache() and getCacheStats()
3. Enhanced Search Hook
   ✅ Created useSearch hook with advanced filtering capabilities
   ✅ Multi-criteria filtering: methods, tags, deprecated status, parameters, request body, response codes
   ✅ Text search with fuzzy matching and relevance scoring
   ✅ useTextSearch convenience wrapper for simple search needs
   ✅ Filter options discovery and clearing functionality

UI/Display control
✅ Headless architecture with render props
✅ CSS className and style prop support
✅ Component-level customization

TODO List - High Priority (Fits headless pattern)

1. Enhanced Spec Loading
   YAML support - currently only accepts parsed JSON objects
   URL loading - fetch specs from remote URLs
   External $ref resolution - resolve references to other files
   Multiple spec versions (OpenAPI 2.0 support)
   Spec caching and validation
2. Advanced Navigation
   Custom ordering/sorting hooks for tags and operations
   Slug/URL generation utilities for operations and tags
   Navigation event hooks (onTagClick, onOperationClick, etc.)
   Breadcrumb utilities
3. Schema Enhancement
   Nested schema expansion/collapse state management
   Schema ordering utilities (required first, alphabetical, etc.)
   Model reference resolution and linking
   Schema validation utilities
4. Search & Filtering
   Advanced search hooks - search within operation descriptions, parameters
   Multi-criteria filtering - by method, tag, parameter type
   Search result ranking/relevance
5. Request Execution Framework
   useExecuteOperation hook for "Try it out" functionality
   Security scheme configuration hooks
   Request/response interceptor system
   Credential management utilities

TODO List - Medium Priority 6. Code Snippets
Code generation utilities - curl, JavaScript, Python, etc.
Custom snippet generator plugin system
Request/response example extraction from spec 7. Performance & Large Specs
Lazy loading utilities for large specs
Async spec loading with loading states
Virtual scrolling utilities for large endpoint lists 8. Multiple Documents
Multi-spec management - handle v1 vs v2 APIs
Document switching utilities and hooks
Spec comparison utilities

❌ Items to Rule Out (Don't fit headless pattern)
Routing/Deep Linking
❌ Hash routing, path routing - This is application-level concern, not library
❌ URL state management - Consumer should handle with their router
❌ Redirect handling - Application routing responsibility
UI/Theming Specifics
❌ Dark/light theme toggles - Consumer handles theme state
❌ CSS customization systems - We provide className/style props instead
❌ Layout configurations - Consumer controls layout completely
Export/Download Features
❌ Download spec functionality - This is application feature, not library
❌ Static HTML generation - Outside scope of headless library
Meta/SEO
❌ Page title, meta tags - Application responsibility
❌ Favicon management - Not library concern
